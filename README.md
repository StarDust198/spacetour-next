## Overview

### The challenge

My goals were to:

- Show optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on device's screen size
- Keep the page accessible(ARIA)
- Smooth transitions, animations and hover states for interactive content

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Space Tour on Vercel](https://spacetour-next.vercel.app//)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup, ARIA-friendly,
- CSS custom properties, CSS Grid
- Module CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library for building user interfaces
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React library for SSR and SEO optimizations
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations & gesutures

### What I learned

There were many CSS and TypeScript/React/Next.js hints I've learnt during building of this app:

- keeping GRID layout simple
- ARIA-attributes and accessibility
- page transitions in Next.js
- different direction of tab transitions for different devices and depending on selected tab

### Continued development

- Add gestures for mobile devices. My previous (React/JS no-TS) version had them based on Framer Motion. Will add them to this version as well.
